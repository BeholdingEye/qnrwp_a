Included widgets are:

1. **Arrow Anim**

  Animated arrow for pointing down, up, left or right. Usually down, on a landing page with a full-page hero image or carousel

2. **Font Resize**

  Resizes the font of the element, usually BODY, in step with changes in the total screen area

3. **Responsive**

  Makes a row of DIVs responsively adjust to screen width

4. **Carousel**

  Fully featured carousel, the centrepiece of the package, with many options

5. **Stickybar**

  A bar lower on the page than the top, that on scrolling the page down, will stick to the top of the page

6. **Slider**

  Non-looping introductory slider, can be used with just one slide for an animated reveal of the element

7. **Image Animator**

  Non-looping introductory image animator, that can zoom images for a fake moving appearance, and accepts an overlay object

8. **Navigator Menu**

  Simple collapsible menu that automatically responds to changes in screen width, vailable separately in "qnr-navmenu-hmenu.js"/"qnr-navmenu-hmenu.css"

9. **Scroller**
