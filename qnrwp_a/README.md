### Overview

QNRWP-A is WordPress done right.

We take full advantage of the metaphors of the platform (Posts, Pages, Categories), and employ them in a classical CMS approach: the website layout and functionality is the work of the web developer, providing the interface for the client to create and edit content.

The idea is that as far as possible the theme should provide functionality natively, not relying on plugins that will require maintenance and upgrades, and may conflict one another.

Combined with disabling of automatic updates, the approach taken by this theme will result in a stable and secure website for years after delivery to the client, with no maintenance required.

### Benefits

QNRWP-A is more fully featured than most themes, offering functionality usually implemented with plugins, saving you money:

* Meta tags, OpenGraph and Twitter cards support.

* Contact Form shortcode, with all parameters controllable. May be used in subscription popouts.

* An "include" shortcode with two modes: 1) files, to import any HTML/JS/CSS/PHP code anywhere; and 2) posts, including posts anywhere.

* Quicknr Interface Javascript widgets, including advanced menus and a carousel.

* Featured News widget, displaying 4 latest news items as a row of cards.

* Sample Cards shortcode, for cards linking to samples and News posts about them.

* Improved image sharpness if the ImageMagick PHP module is installed on the server, and optimized image presentation for high Google Page Speed scores.

* Additional image sizes defined, beyond the paltry Large size of 1024px that is inadequate for today's screens. At the same time, overly large uploads are downsized to 2500px width, solving the problem of editors uploading unoptimized images.

* Image regeneration.

* Cookie/privacy notice for EU regulatory compliance.

* Quick access to posts and pages for editing in the admin, and a simplified interface for editors there.

* Semi-automated layout. Appearance of sidebars is controlled with visibility of widgets in them, a feature natively supported by the theme.

* Tested and compatible with WooCommerce, Advanced Custom Fields, SiteOrigin Page Builder plugins. This theme should be compatible with all well-made plugins.

### Caveats

* This is a business theme, supporting News postings without support for comments. Not a theme for bloggers.
