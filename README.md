# qnrwp_a

Bare-bones Wordpress theme for web developers, using Quicknr Interface widgets.

Note that Quicknr Interface is not included. To use it, create a "res" folder in the theme folder, and place the QI "css", "font" and "js" folders in it.

In addition, this theme separates interface graphics from images used in News Posts. To use images in interface widgets, create an "img" folder in the "res" folder and place the images in it.

This theme will be developed rapidly. No releases will be packaged - the latest commit is the latest version.

More details are at the sample site for the theme: http://quicknr.fast-page.org/wp/ .
