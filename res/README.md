# Quicknr-Interface

Javascript and CSS interface widgets for web pages and web apps.
-----------------

A lighter alternative to Bootstrap, does not depend on jQuery

Documentation is presently available only as a comment block at the top of the "js/qnr-interface.js" file.

GPL licensed. The package includes fonts based on work by others, namely Iconic and Font Awesome.

From version 1.5.0 onward, QI is no longer updated independently on GitHub; it is maintained as part of the QNRWP-A Wordpress theme.

Included widgets are:

1. **Arrow Anim**

  Animated arrow for pointing down, up, left or right. Usually down, on a landing page with a full-page hero image or carousel

2. **Font Resize**

  Resizes the font of the element, usually BODY, in step with changes in the total screen area

3. **Responsive**

  Makes a row of DIVs responsively adjust to screen width

4. **Carousel**

  Fully featured carousel, the centrepiece of the package, with many options

5. **Stickybar**

  A bar lower on the page than the top, that on scrolling the page down, will stick to the top of the page

6. **Slider**

  Non-looping introductory slider, can be used with just one slide for an animated reveal of the element

7. **Image Animator**

  Non-looping introductory image animator, that can zoom images for a fake moving appearance, and accepts an overlay object

8. **Navigator Menu**

  Simple collapsible menu that automatically responds to changes in screen width

9. **Scroller**

  Parallax scrolling widget

10. **Winscroller**

  Any clickable object can be made a winscroller, animatedly scrolling the page to a target object. On the BODY tag, will create a "return to top" arrow on the bottom right of the window

11. **X Icon**

  Close icon that can be applied to objects for hiding or removing them from the page

12. **Accordion**

  Clickable questions that reveal answers

13. **Hierarchical Menu**

  In addition, since version 1.2.0, a separate widget, hierarchical menu, has been added. The menu is separately deployable because most websites will not require it. However, the menu depends on the rest of the QI files, that must be linked to earlier in the HTML source code.

14. **Aspect Keeper**

  New in version 1.5.0 is this widget, preserving the object's aspect ratio at different screen sizes. This helps prevent images and videos displaying "tall" when they should be "narrow", usually on mobile screens in portrait mode.
